# Master-s-thesis---MSc-Industrial-Ecology
You will find here the scripts, data and readme files of my thesis. 


There are 6 folders on this repository:
- 'Cleaning and shaping ICIO': scripts allowing to shape the ICIO tables provided by Kopp (2025) in a format fit for the thesis
- 'Egalitarianism', 'Liberal Egalitarianism', and 'Sufficientarianism': scripts and data to build justice footprint scenarios
- 'Circular economy policy': scripts and data implementing CEP into ICIO tables.
- 'Results analysis': scripts performing the scenario comparision

Some data is missing in this repository but is available on request. These data are: 
- the ICIO tables (Kopp, 2025) used as input in the 'Cleaning and shaping ICIO'
- the Exiobase Y matrix in the sufficientarianism folder.
